T1 = """ Trump's Middle East peace plan: 'Deal of the century' is huge gamble At times the atmosphere in the East Room at the White House was more a party than a news conference.

The host, US President Donald Trump, and the guest of honour, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, backslappingly beamed at each other. The guests drawn from the entourages of the two leaders clapped and whooped.

The biggest cheers were for President Trump's reminders of what he has done for Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu said the day would be remembered in the same breath as Israel's day of independence in 1948. It was, said Mr Netanyahu, one of the most important moments of his life.

President Trump says he has found a new way to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel will get the security it needs. Palestinians will get the state they crave.

So far so good - except that the Trump plan gives Mr Netanyahu all he wants - and offers Palestinians very little; a sort-of state that will be truncated, without proper sovereignty, surrounded by Israel's territory and threaded between Jewish settlements.

Peace seemed possible, once
President Trump may believe, truly and without doubt, that he is offering the "deal of the century". It is a great deal for Mr Netanyahu and his government. Their positions on the Palestinians, more than ever, are America's positions.Through all the years of mediation in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, the top US priorities have always been Israel's wishes, constraints and most of all its security. But successive US presidents accepted that peace required a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel, even if they were not prepared to allow it equal sovereignty.
Israel argues the Palestinians turned down a series of good offers. The Palestinian negotiators say they made huge concessions, not least accepting Israel's existence in around 78% of their historic homeland.

A negotiated peace did seem possible once, almost 30 years ago. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by a beaming President Bill Clinton.Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's greatest war leader, and Yasser Arafat, the human embodiment of Palestinian hopes for freedom, signed documents promising to negotiate the future, not fight for it. The two bitter enemies even shook hands. Rabin, Arafat, and Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Oslo was a historic moment. The Palestinians recognised the state of Israel. The Israelis accepted that the Palestine Liberation Organisation represented the Palestinian people.

Cracks soon appeared in the Oslo edifice. Benjamin Netanyahu called it a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. Some Palestinians, like the academic Edward Said, condemned Oslo as a surrender. The Palestinian militants of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, sent suicide bombers to kill Jews and wreck the chances of a deal.

The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly. Yitzhak Rabin was demonised by some of his fellow Israelis as no better than a Nazi, and portrayed at demonstrations as an officer of the SS. Months of incitement culminated in his assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995. Surrender document
Rabin's killer wanted to wreck the peace process, and he believed the best way to do that was to eliminate the Israeli best equipped to make it a reality. He was right.

Even if Rabin had lived, Oslo might still have failed, defeated by small details as well as huge issues like the future of Jerusalem, by leaders on both sides who preferred conflict to compromise and by the violent reality of a continued Israeli occupation and Palestinian opposition to it.The timing of the announcement of the Trump initiative suits the political and legal needs of Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu. Both men face elections. As well as that, Mr Trump gets a distraction from his impeachment, and from his trial in the US Senate for high crimes and misdemeanours. Mr Netanyahu faces criminal charges of corruption, bribery and breach of trust.

President Trump wastes no chances to boast about America's strength. He believes that America's military and economic strength allow him to impose his will. He wants to smash old orthodoxies, like the ones that lay behind many failed attempts to make peace.

The Trump document also sweeps aside inconvenient facts, like UN resolution 242 that emphasises the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war, or international laws that say that occupiers cannot settle their people on occupied land.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejected the document almost immediately. Palestinian rights and hopes, he said, were not for sale.

Essentially the Palestinians have been told to take it or leave it. They are being given a surrender document, told to accept that Israel has won, and with its American friends will shape the future. If Palestinians refuse, the message continues, Israel will still get what it wants and they will be even worse off.

There is a chance Palestinians will be afflicted by more anger, despair and hopelessness. In a combustible part of the world, that is dangerous. The Trump plan is a gamble.

Trump Unveils Middle East Peace Plan

U.S. President Donald Trump delivers joint remarks on a Middle East peace plan proposal with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Jan. 28, 2020.
WHITE HOUSE - Hoping to bring about a “new dawn in the Middle East,” U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his peace plan for the region on Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu standing at his side.  

“My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides, a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel’s security,” Trump said in the White House East Room.    

Notably absent was any representative of the Palestinians, who rejected the peace plan even before getting a glimpse of the 80-page proposal, and who were not included in talks about the plan.  “Jerusalem is not for sale. All our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain. And your deal, the conspiracy, will not pass,” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in televised remarks directed at Trump from Ramallah in the West Bank. 

Trump sees such initial rejections as a temporary hitch and told those gathered in the East Room that he sent a letter to Abbas, telling him that if he chooses “the path to peace, America and many other countries, we will be there. We will be there to help you in so many different ways.”Acceptance of the plan would lead to $50 billion of outside investment, a million jobs created for Palestinians over a decade, and a doubling or tripling of Palestinians' GDP, Trump promised.

“It is time for the Muslim world to fix the mistake it made in 1948 when it chose to attack, instead of recognize, the new State of Israel,” the president said.

Egypt, one of the countries that declared war on Israel at that time, is not rejecting Trump’s vision.

The country expressed appreciation of continuing U.S. efforts to realize a fair and comprehensive peaceful settlement for the Palestinian problem, according to the Middle East News Agency in Cairo.

"Jordan supports every genuine effort aimed at achieving just and comprehensive peace that people will accept," Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said in a statement.

Present in the East Room were the ambassadors of Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

“What a pleasure to see you here,” remarked Netanyahu. “And what a sign it portends of the present.”
Analysts say a public statement from Riyadh lending Saudi support to Trump’s plan would carry more weight, as the kingdom is the dominant Sunni Muslim power.

Later Tuesday, the Saudis released a statement, which said, "In light of the (U.S.) announcement, the kingdom reiterates its support for all efforts aimed at reaching a just and comprehensive resolution to the Palestinian cause."

The kingdom appreciates "the efforts of President Trump's administration to develop a comprehensive peace plan between the Palestinian and Israeli sides," the statement continued.

Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said Wednesday that at first reading the plan indicates a great waste of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, but that the group is carefully studying it and is open to any serious effort to achieve peace.

France’s foreign ministry also said it was taking a close look at the proposal while reiterating the necessity for a two-state solution.

Trump proposes a Palestine with limited sovereignty — doubling the size of land currently occupied by Palestinians — and Israel annexing about a third of the disputed West Bank.  

Israel’s government is now set to vote Sunday on annexing the strategic Jordan Valley and all Israeli settlements in the West Bank. 
Jerusalem would remain Israel’s capital, and the eastern part of the holy city would be the Palestinian capital where the United States would open an embassy to Palestine, said Trump. 

“I’m prepared to seize the moment and change history,” Netanyahu told the invited crowd of supporters. "Your deal of the century is the opportunity of the century,” he told Trump.

Netanyahu said if the Palestinians abide by the terms laid out, “Israel will be prepared to negotiate peace right away.”

Analysts see the Israelis, strongly backed at least during the current administration in Washington, as having the position of strength.
“It does not seem as though the Palestinians have a constructive way out. They no longer enjoy the intense, or financial support of many of the Arab powers,” Thomas Schwartz, a professor of history and political science at Vanderbilt University told VOA. “It may seem like a take it or leave it. But it may be the best deal that they are going to get. That's one of the tougher questions that the Palestinian leadership will have to face.”

Above the many problems with the substance of the plan is the fundamental issue of how it was devised, according to Palestinian analysts.

"Any offer toward the Palestinians and any offer of peace should be a negotiation between the Palestinians and Israelis, and that's not the case with this deal,” U.S. policy fellow Halah Ahmad, at the Palestinian policy network Al-Shabaka, told VOA.

The plan, after nearly three years of discussion between U.S. and Israeli officials, was overseen by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who long has had close ties to Netanyahu and Israel.

It involves some exotic proposals, including a high-speed rail link between Gaza and the West Bank, according to David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel.

“It doesn’t really matter in the short run what the Palestinians say,” Friedman told reporters on a conference call. “They have four years to study it.”

As Friedman spoke to reporters, Trump tweeted a map showing the divisions of territory."""
